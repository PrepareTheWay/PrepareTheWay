- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PrepareTheWay
- Iâ€™m interested in electronics, programming, and communication systems. 
- I've only started seriously studying this world of electronics at the start of Sep. 2023. I am a newborn!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how RF signals are used to transmit data through space and how I can write code and use programmable outputs on a microcontroller
  to send data with its own protocols. 

-Please message me through GIT if you have any feedback or advice. As a beginner with no experience whatsoever, I appreciate anything from you veterans!
